We're back! From outer spa... nope, we're not doing that... **moving on**!  
We have once again convened at the **Arctic Beard Emergency HQ**, crunching to get our new game ready for an audience (yes, that's you!).

We felt like we had to defy the cold weather (-18 C°) to get some BBQ goin' on!  
Since we have "Arctic" in our name and live in northern Sweden, 
we had no choice but to go out in the cold and start grillin'!

But back to the sweet stuff, we're actually super excited to show you what we're working on, but all in good time!  

Since you have been so patient we felt like giving you something, a fresh first peak at our game!

Hope this small update will at least show you that we're still in it, working hard!
Stay updated at the website and our socials to get the latest information about our upcoming game!
