Okay this is what happened...

Like many other games we need animations for our character so, I loaded up Blender and opened our rigged character (with automatic weights... _don't tell anyone_ ðŸ‘€).

I had an idea, why animate if we can just grab some from Mixamo?  
We might want custom animation later but it should be good for now.  
Great, let's do it!

I typed "mixamo.com" into the address bar, found a sweet dancing animation and downloaded it.  
Which looks like ðŸ‘‡ for reference.

Nothing fancy yet...

But it wasn't a great fit for our skeleton/rig.  
Alright let's just use the retarget tools in Blender's mocap add-on!  
Ok, something is off, doesn't look very good...

This is the point where the naive section of my brain kicks in and i think...

I do it easy peasy! Ok, let's see it, <i>\*hits Alt + A\*</i>
