Sorry we missed a post during *Dev Weekend 1* two weeks ago... ðŸ˜ž

But onwards to the good news! We've been making alot of progress since the last post and the gameplay is improving day by day. 

Check out the video below for a preview of the hottest build, fresh off the assembly line! ðŸŽ‰

We're busy developing the game so this is a short one, but hopefully we'll have lots more coming soon.  

Stay tuned! ðŸ“»
