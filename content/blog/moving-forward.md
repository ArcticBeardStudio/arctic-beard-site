We've been silent for a while now but we've been busy applying for a grant to the [The Ministry of Silly Walks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ministry_of_Silly_Walks).  
And everything was going fine!  

![Imagine someone flailing around with his arms here](/blog/moving-forward/flailing.gif)

But then we hit a wall...

![Imagine someone running into a wall repeatedly](/blog/moving-forward/wall-run.gif)

Not being too discouraged, we managed to rise from the ashes, reborn again like a phoenix we implemented auto crouch.

![Imagine someone gracefully crouch under an obstacle](/blog/moving-forward/auto-crouch.gif)

So in the end we're happily moving forward!

Jokes aside...  
This is actually a final product.  
Jokes aside, again, it's not...  
It's really work in progress of an animation system we're developing in Unreal for our game Kontroll!

We have also been working on making our camera controller a real gem ðŸ’Ž and we got a **GAME JAM** coming up soon!

Until then, have a good one!
